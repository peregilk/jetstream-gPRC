The question below is written in a specific language. Evaluate each aspect as follows:

• error_freeness – Give a score from 1 (poor) to 5 (completely free of linguistic errors according to the rules of the language in which it is written).  
• answerability – Give a score from 1 (ambiguous or multiple possible answers) to 5 (clearly formulated with only one possible correct answer).  
• general_knowledge_fit – **true** if it is realistic that a person with excellent knowledge of the language and culture can answer correctly; **false** only if the question is effectively unanswerable (e.g., requires private information or unverifiable facts).  
Return **only** this JSON object:

{{  
  "error_freeness": <1-5>,  
  "answerability": <1-5>,  
  "general_knowledge_fit": <true|false>  
}}
